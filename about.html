	      <strong><em>Short History of DRACEA: </em></strong>
		<br/>
	1927 was a remarkable and epoch making year in the history of modern Indian shipping. History tells us that India was a vast sea power in olden days. 
But in India there were no facilities to impart training to Indians to become merchant navy officers till 1927. 
The Great visionary Sir P. S. sivaswamy Iyer strong advocacy for the cause resulted in acceptance of a resolution on 19 March 1926 by the Central Government 
to commence the Indian Mercantile Marine, the Ministry of Commerce, accordingly acquired troopship Dufferin and the three-year course for the first batch 
commenced on Dufferin on 5 December 1927 with 26 cadets. The first cadet Ramdas Katari who was later to become the first Indian commander-in-chief of the 
Indian Navy belonged to this very batch. T. S. Dufferin was afloat for a period of 67 years of which 45 years were off Mazgaon pier having trained 2656 cadets. 
It is a matter of great pride that four Chiefs of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy, many admirals, four Nautical advisors and two chief surveyors with the 
Government of India had their training at  Dufferin besides many senior executives and masters in various shipping companies. T. S. Rajendra was named 
after King Rajendra Chola. T. S. Rajendra had been specifically designed and built as a modern training ship by Hindustan Shipyard to train 250 cadets at
 a time as against 160 earlier. T. S. Rajendra served illustriously for 21 years by not only training a large number of cadets but also the saloon crew. 
The Government of India decided with great foresight to set up a shore based academy for training of nautical cadets so that output could be substantially increased.
 The shore based academy christened T. S. Chanakya was inaugurated on 5 April 1993, National Maritime Day. T. S. Chanakya became operational on 1 August 1993
 and teaches the cadets the new order but also makes them upholders of the old ones.
